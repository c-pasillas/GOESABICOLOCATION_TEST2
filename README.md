# GOESABICOLOCATION_TEST2
this is a small sample of the the data and code I am using to try to get it all resampled 
to the same grid and save as a .npz thats a dict of the arrazy so I can then use for next step.

I normally have all of this in a folder called night2day and then i call things like

night2day ABI-only pathtoabifiles

night2day -h shows all the options for the full package. ive commetned all out except crop, common, ABI_only and ABI_raw_process_small in hopes to have a "small working example"

Unfortunately raw files are too big for git so i have added them to a google drive and sharing that here
